# Abstract

An ethical analysis of the Open Source methodology guided by:

* Utilitarianism
* Professional ethics
* A concrete look at the software industry

# What is Open Source Software

OSS is software in which the **source code** is released to the **public** under a permissive license, which allows the software to be freely:

* Run
* Studied
* Changed
* Redistributed

\vspace{10bp}

It is an alternative to Proprietary Software, where the source code is instead hidden from the user by means of Intellectual Property laws

# Open Source as an engineering practice

*Open source is a **development methodology**; free software is a social movement* (Stallman)

\vspace{6bp}

Open Source development can be an efficient way to build high quality, peer-reviewed, secure software

\vspace{6bp}

In some applications Open Source is widely considered an engineering standard (e.g. cryptography libraries)

# Getting philosophical

In this presentation we intend to analyze the engineering practice of Open Source from a **moral point of view**

\vspace{8bp}

Is it a more ethical alternative to Proprietary Software?

# Establishing a framework

The Open Source choice:

* Has several practical implications
* Is well-established
* Concerns engineering

We are led to focus on its **consequences**

In a **utilitarian framework**, a moral action is the one that brings the greatest benefits to the largest number of people

It seems the most natural perspective to reason about our problem

# OSS vs PS

Let's start by considering a very **general scenario**

A company has just completed the development of a program and is ready to release the first version to the public

What are the **consequences of open sourcing** the program?

* On the users
* On the company and the developers
* On all the other computer professionals

# OSS impact on the users

* Virtually **everybody can get a copy** easily and inexpensively

  * Nobody is tempted or compelled to run illegal copies

* Users can get to **know** exactly **what the software does**

  * Experts can check that the code does not contain malicious parts (backdoors, privacy abusing mechanisms, etc.) and...

  * ...inform the rest of the user base

# OSS impact on its developers / producing company

* Product quality is showcased by the source code

* Possibly broader market (due to higher accessibility and openness to contribution of platform ports)

* Directly **selling the software** will probably **not** be as **profitable**

# OSS impact on other developers

Any other developer will have the possibility to:

* **Learn** from the code

* **Customize** the code and publish modifications

* **Reuse** the code in another project (complying with the license)

* Develop an **interoperable** program

# Some further questions

We have shown how an Open Source approach can be more **beneficial for the community** of users and developers as a whole

\vspace{10bp}

We still have to address some points:

* Are OSS developers properly rewarded for their labor?

* Is Open Source compatible with the ethics of engineers?

* Can Open Source be a universal choice?

# Open Source and rewards

Sometimes actions are driven by motivations different than profit

\vspace{6bp}

Many **enthusiasts** contribute to Open Source projects as **volunteers** in their free time

\vspace{6bp}

According to E. S. Raymond, the Open Source hacker community is a **gift culture** whose members **compete for prestige** through code

# Open Source and rewards

However developing OSS does **not** imply **working for free**

\vspace{6bp}

A company can fund an Open Source project in a number of ways:

* Offering services related to the software
* Affiliating with commercial partners and sponsors
* Launching fundraising campaigns
* Selling other products or services

\vspace{6bp}

Empirical data suggests that around 50% of all contributions to renowned Open Source projects are paid work now (Riehle et al.)

# Open Source and engineers

Organizations like the IEEE and the ACM issue codes of professional ethics for engineers and IT professionals

\vspace{6bp}

These codes stress some common important points that Open Source seems to serve particularly well due to its public impact:

* Contributing to the **public welfare**
* Promoting **collaboration among experts**
* Improving the public **understanding of technology**

# Open Source and engineers

Furthermore Open Source facilitates large collective efforts and reuse of code, ultimately speeding up innovation

\vspace{8bp}

This is in line with the typical engineering ideals of **efficiency** and **technological enthusiasm**

# Open Source and universality

We have shown a number of ways to fund Open Source development, however its adoption does **rule out some business models**

*In the case of a business that wishes to* ***produce software for sale*** [...] *Open Source will be a difficult product to monetize* (Perens)

\vspace{8bp}

Moreover some argue that **Intellectual Property** can **incentivize innovation** and protect small companies in competitive areas

* Critics such as Stallman and Lessig have nonetheless pointed out controversial effects of current IP mechanisms

* The debate extends beyond the scope of this presentation

# Open Source and universality

Under the current economic framework, Open Source may **not always** be a **self-sustainable** model

\vspace{6bp}

The most conservative approach is still to **leave the decision** among open or closed source **to companies and developers**

\vspace{6bp}

This lets consumers get the best from both worlds and does not put artificial constraints on the industry

# Conclusion?

According to P. Kollock's definition, **Open Source programs** can be regarded as **public goods** (indivisible and non-excludable)

\vspace{6bp}

In light of this, we argue that the development of useful Open Source Software should be publicly protected and encouraged

\vspace{6bp}

Citizens should be educated about the benefits offered by Open Source Software in terms of privacy and security

\vspace{6bp}

Public institutions should adopt valid Open Source alternatives whenever they reduce costs and promote interoperability

# Conclusion!
