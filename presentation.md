# What is Open Source Software

Software in which the source code is released to the public under a permissive license, which typically allows the software to be freely:

* Run
* Studied
* Changed
* Redistributed

# Open source as an engineering practice

Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement (Stallman)
